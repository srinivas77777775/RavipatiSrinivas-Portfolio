### Design and Development of DL framework for classification and grading of Diabetic Retinopathy from fundus image.

- Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious eye disorder which leads to vision loss and blindness. It is essential to detect DR in advance in order to prevent worsening.
- The purpose of this project is to create and deploy a capable deep learning model for the classification and diagnosis of various levels of diabetic retinopathy through retinal fundus images.
- DR Can be divided into 2 types depending on the fundus images. They are **Non-Proliferative DR(NPDR)**, **Proliferative DR(PDR)**, No DR. Again, NPDR is categorized as 3 types. They are **Mild diabetic retinopathy**, **Moderate diabetic retinopathy**, and **Severe diabetic retinopathy**.
- Image preprocessing methods were utilized for enhancement of image quality.
- **CLAHE preprocessing** method was employed for preprocessing.
- Used models in this project are **VGG-16**, **Xception**, **Densenet 121**. Multiclass classification of images was done. Each model gives higher accuracies which shows the perfect working of the models.
